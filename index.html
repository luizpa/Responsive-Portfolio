      <img src="./assets/images/profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Paulo Mederos">

      <p>Born and raised in Peru. Decided to move to the US in ’04 and landed in NJ when I was 19 years old. With a new culture, language and not knowing many people I made my way through it. I currently live in Charlotte NC and work as a painting contractor with Four Seasons Painting, a company I own.
        I feel capable of doing many things, anything I set my mind to. That’s why I decided to switch careers and start a journey as a web developer.</p>

      <p>I chose web developing because that’s where we’re heading. As technology develops at this pace soon, this language will become a basic need. With that said, it’s also very big field that allows me to be creative in many ways. Web developing  is a part of my life now and as every day goes by I’m learning something new.
        </p>

      <p>Through my portfolio you’ll find different projects I’ve done and you can also get it touch with me.</p>
